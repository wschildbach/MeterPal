MeterPal is an application to keep track of meters in and around your house.

You can enter your electricity readings and get an overview over your daily
electricity use. Enter your car mileage, and keep a log of the miles you
drive everyday. Etc.

MeterPal is an app in development. If you are interested in contributing
give me a shout at meterpal@fermi.franken.de.
